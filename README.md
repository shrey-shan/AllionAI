# AllionAI â€“ Voice Agent Setup

This project runs a LiveKit-based voice agent in two modes:

- **Console Mode** â†’ Local testing in your terminal  
- **Dev/Web Mode** â†’ Connect to the hosted frontend: [AllionAI Web App](https://agent-starter-react-sigma.vercel.app/)

```bash
AllionAI/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/pdf_source/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rag_config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assistant_core.py

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vision_capabilities.py
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/

```

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrey-shan/AllionAI.git
cd AllionAI
```

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It
**Windows**
```bash
python -m venv allion
allion\Scripts\activate
```
**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python -m venv allion
source allion/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_rag.txt
```

---

## 4. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# LiveKit Connection
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<your_project_id>.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>

# Agent Settings
LIVEKIT_ROOM=my-test-room
AGENT_ID=agent1

# Model Provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_or_openrouter_key>
```

---

## 5. Setup RAG Vector Store (One-Time)
If you plan to use the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities with your own PDF documents, run this script once to process them and create the local vector database.

```bash
python scripts/setup_rag.py
```
- Place your PDF files in the `docs/pdf_source/` directory before running.

---

## 6. Download Required Files
```bash
python -m src.multilingual_agent download-files
```

---

## 7a. Run in Console Mode (Local Testing)
```bash
python -m src.multilingual_agent en console
```
- Use your microphone to talk to the agent in the terminal.  
- Ideal for quick debugging and testing.

---

## 7b. Run in Dev Mode (Connect to Web App)
```bash
python -m src.multilingual_agent dev
```
- Starts the LiveKit agent worker and joins the specified room.  
- Go to the frontend web app:  
  ðŸ‘‰Custom  : [https://agent-starter-react-custom.vercel.app/](http://agent-starter-react-custom.vercel.app/)
- Enter the same room name as in `.env` (`LIVEKIT_ROOM`) to interact with your agent via browser.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### RAG Hallucinations or Stale Data

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system relies on a local vector database (ChromaDB) located in the `vectorstore_multi_pdf` directory. This database stores indexed data from your PDF documents.

**Problem:**

You might encounter a situation where the RAG system provides answers that are not present in your source documents (a "hallucination") or reflects outdated information. This can happen if:
1.  The vector database contains stale data from previously indexed documents that are no longer in `docs/pdf_source/`.
2.  The retrieval system is finding irrelevant chunks of text that are still close enough in the vector space to be selected, causing the AI model to ignore the context and answer from its general knowledge.

**Solution:**

The most reliable solution is to completely remove the existing vector database and let the system rebuild it from scratch. This ensures the RAG system is using only the most current documents in your `docs/pdf_source/` directory.

**To clear the vector store, run the appropriate command for your operating system in the project root directory:**

**Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)**
```bash
rmdir /s /q vectorstore_multi_pdf
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
rm -rf vectorstore_multi_pdf
```

After deleting the directory, the RAG system will automatically re-create and re-index it the next time it is initialized (e.g., by running `scripts/setup_rag.py` or by starting the main application).
